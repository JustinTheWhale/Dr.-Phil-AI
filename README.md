# Dr. Phil AI

## About 

#### Python program that records your voice, creates a text transcription of your voice, uses the transcription as input to ChatGPT, and plays ChatGPT's response in Dr. Phil's voice. You can technically do any voice with ElevenLabs but I chose Dr. Phil in this case.

#### Tested and working on Python 3.10. Should work on others too. Additionally I've only used this on Windows but I'm sure others can figure out MacOS and Linux.

## Installation 
### Windows
- #### Make an account for ChatGPT and ElevenLabs.
- #### Clone this repo or download the zipped source code.
- #### Create an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) account and get an API key
- #### Requires [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be in your PATH to playback the sound.
- #### Install [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) with ``` pip install SpeechRecognition ```
- #### Install [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) with ``` pip install pydub ```
